# HERE WITH THE REWRITE!

You already know, it's MoJava!

## contributions are so welcome!
if you want something to get added, and you know java, you could try adding it by yourself!
 - clone the repo 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmarKherala/MoJava.git
```
 - implement stuff!

## adding commands
as you can see, there's a `/commands` folder. inside it there are 2 folders one for
text commands and the other for slash commands, to make a new command just create a new java class
and implement the `SlashCommand` or the `TextCommand` interfaces and start filling in the implemented methods!

so long nerds...
